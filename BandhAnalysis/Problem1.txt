Political parties in Bengal show their muscle by calling for regular bandhs (strikes), which cause considerable economic damage. For our purposes, each party may be characterized 
by a positive integer b called the bandh parameter that denotes the average number of days between two successive strikes called by the given party. 

Consider three political parties. Assume b1 = 3, b2 = 4, and b3 = 8, where bi is the bandh parameter for party i. We can simulate the behavior of these three parties for N = 14 
days. We always start the simulation on a Monday. There are no bandhs on either Saturdays or Sundays. 

            1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14

    Party 1         X           X           X           X       
    Party 2             X               X               X       
    Party 3                             X                       
    Bandhs          1   2               3   4           5       

    There will be exactly five bandhs (on days 3, 4, 8, 9, and 12) over the 14 days. There is no bandh on day 6 since it falls on Saturday. Hence we lose five working days in two 
    weeks. Given the bandh parameters for several political parties and the value of N, determine the number of working days lost in those N days. 

    Input 
    The first line of the input consists of a single integer T giving the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (7 ≤ N ≤ 365,000), 
    giving the number of days over which the simulation must be run. The next line contains another integer P (1 ≤ P ≤ 100) representing the number of political parties. The ith 
    of the next P lines contains a positive integer bi (which will never be a multiple of 7) giving the bandh parameter for party i (1 ≤ i ≤ P).  
    The sample input below has 2 test cases. The first test case has 14 days and 3 parties with bandh parameters 3, 4, 8. 
    The second test case has 100 days and 4 parties with bandh parameters 12, 15, 25, 40.

    Output 
    For each test case, output the number of working days lost on a separate line. In the sample output below, 5 is the working days lost for test case 1 and 15  
    is the working days lost for test case 2.
